A function that creates a new [[CoroutineContext]] with a single thread, therefore is confined to this single thread. It can be used like a [[Dispatcher]], however, predefined Dispatchers use some thread pool, whereas `newSingleThreadContext()` creates the thread itself.

```kotlin
import kotlinx.coroutines.*

fun main() = runBlocking {
    val singleThreadContext = newSingleThreadContext("MySingleThread")

    launch(singleThreadContext) {
        println("Running in single thread context: ${Thread.currentThread().name}")
    }
	
	singleThreadContext.close()
}
```

In many cases, you are able to achieve your goals using predefined Dispatchers, but if your case is different, maybe using newSingleThreadContext is a must.

## Important Considerations

- Creating a new single thread can be resource-intensive. `newSingleThreadContext()` lifecycle is not managed automatically and has to be closed explicitly by using `close()` function.
- newSingleThreadContext can introduce performance bottlenecks if overused.
