A [[Dispatcher]] that is not confined to any specific thread. Its execution is started on the caller thread (a thread, where coroutine with Unconfined dispatcher is created) but only until the first suspension point. After suspension, the thread coroutine resumes on is determined solely by the suspending function that was invoked. The unconfined dispatcher is appropriate for coroutines which neither consume CPU time nor update any shared data (like UI) confined to a specific thread.
