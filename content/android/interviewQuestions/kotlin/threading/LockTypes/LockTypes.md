While interacting with concurrent programming, it is crucial to not allow multiple threads to access the same piece of data because it can lead to data inconsistency. So Kotlin provides several lock types for JVM that enable developers to synchronize access to shared resources.
[[Mutex]]
[[ReadWriteLock]]
[[ReentrantLock]]
[[Semaphore]]
[[synchronized]]
[[Deadlock]]
