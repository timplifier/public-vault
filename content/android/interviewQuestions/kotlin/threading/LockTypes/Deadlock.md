**Deadlock** is a situation where two or more threads are blocked forever by waiting for each other to release a resource. This situation is like a stalemate in chess, where none of the players can make a move without putting themselves in check.

**Deadlock** can occur in system with limited resources and threads/processes need to lock these resources during their operations. The classic condition that can lead to **Deadlock**, known as the Coffman conditions are:

## Deadlock occurrence conditions

- **Mutual Exclusion:** At least one resource must be held in a non-shareable mode; that is, only one thread at a time can use the resource. If another thread wants it, it must wait until the resource is released.
- **Hold and Wait**: A thread is holding at least one resource and waiting to acquire additional resources that are currently being held by other threads.
- **No Preemption**: Resources cannot be forcibly removed from the threads that are holding them; the threads must release their resources voluntarily.
- **Circular Wait**: There exists a set of waiting threads T1,T2, â€¦, _Tn_ such that T1 is waiting for a resource held by T2, T2 is waiting for a resource held by T3, ..., and Tn is waiting for a resource held by T1.

In this example, we can see a **Deadlock** occurrence:

Thread 1 holds **Resource A** and needs **Resource B** to proceed.

Thread 2 holds **Resource B** and needs **Resource A** to proceed.

In this situation, neither thread can proceed because each is waiting for the other to release the resource they need. They are in a **Deadlock**.

## Prevention and Resolution

Avoiding deadlocks involves ensuring that at least one of the Coffman conditions is not met. Some common strategies include:

- **Lock Ordering**: Always acquire locks in a consistent global order.
- **Lock Timeout**: Implement a timeout when trying to acquire locks. If the lock is not acquired within the timeout period, the thread releases any other locks it holds and retries after some time.
- **Resource Allocation Graphs**: Detecting cycles in resource allocation graphs can help identify potential deadlocks.
- **Preemption**: If a deadlock is detected, preempting some resources can break the cycle.

Deadlocks can be particularly tricky to identify and resolve in complex systems because they may occur infrequently and under specific conditions that are hard to replicate in testing. Careful design and thorough testing are essential for systems where resources are shared among multiple threads or processes.
