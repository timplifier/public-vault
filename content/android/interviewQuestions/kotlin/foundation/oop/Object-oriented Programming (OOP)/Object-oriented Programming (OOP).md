Object-oriented Programming, OOP in short is a programming paradigm that encourages developers to organize their code around real life objects and models. It is an opposite to functional programming. These objects can have unique attributes and behavior.

OOP consists of four principles ( pillars ) :

[[Encapsulation]]
[[Abstraction]]
[[Inheritance]]
[[Polymorphism]]
However, some people assume and think that OOP consists only of three principles, those are:

- [[Encapsulation]]
- [[Inheritance]]
- [[Polymorphism]]

They consider [[Abstraction]] as part of the [[Inheritance]].It can be due to variety of reasons, such as:

- Educational Focus. Their curriculum could be targeting only 3 principles, uniting [[Abstraction]] with [[Inheritance]].
- Practical Usage. In practical programming, one could use some principles more often than the others.
- Simplification. In order to simplify the OOP concepts for beginners, they might not have mentioned about [[Abstraction]] at some point.

Yet in modern programming, there are 4 principles and nowadays in any programming article you are going to find that there are 4 of them.
