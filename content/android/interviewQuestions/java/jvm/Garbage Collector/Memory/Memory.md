Every application that relies on [[JVM]] requires some kind of memory to use. The memory is usually taken from the available RAM of the system where application is running. Every function call, object allocation and variable initialization is managed entirely by [[JVM]] and space clean up is done seamlessly so developers don't even have to think about it and most of them barely know how it works. In [[JVM]], there are essentially two types of memory:
- [[Stack]]
- [[Heap]]
