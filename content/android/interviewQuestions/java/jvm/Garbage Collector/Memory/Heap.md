Java Heap space is used for objects an JRE classes memory allocation. All the instantiated objects are held here. They are declared globally and are available to anyone to use. Unlike [[Stack]], Heap memory treats objects as individual cell where each individual cell can be accessed at any time and any order. As were said in [[Stack]] article, available space for Heap is much larger than for [[Stack]]  and there is just one Heap for the whole JVM application, because objects can be referenced across several [[Stack]]s.
In even default JVM application, we create a lot of [[Object]]s, arrays, manipulate those objects and even if we not clear them by ourselves, it is done literally silently without our notice and our program works just fine without any throttling or lag. 
[[Garbage Collector]] is available to free the space.
